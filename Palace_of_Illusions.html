    <p>
      Relevant to today's war-torn world, The Palace of Illusions takes us back
      to a time that is half history, half myth, and wholly magical. Narrated by
      Panchaali, the wife of the legendary Pandavas brothers in the Mahabharat,
      the novel gives us a new interpretation of this ancient tale.<br />The
      Palace of Illusions traces the princess Panchaali's life, beginning with
      her birth in fire and following her spirited balancing act as a woman with
      five husbands who have been cheated out of their fatherâ€™s kingdom.
      Panchaali is swept into their quest to reclaim their birthright, remaining
      at their side through years of exile and a terrible civil war involving
      all the important kings of India. Meanwhile, we never lose sight of her
      strategic duels with her mother-in-law, her complicated friendship with
      the enigmatic Krishna, or her secret attraction to the mysterious man who
      is her husbands' most dangerous enemy. Panchaali is a fiery female
      redefining for us a world of warriors, gods, and the ever-manipulating
      hands of fate.<br />
